# Colligo: A framework for decentralized collaborative development

This is a project for a one semester master thesis for my Masters at Aarhus University.

Colligo is a framework of tools that together offer a decentralized alternative for Dropbox (file sharing ) and Github,Gitlab etc. (project management).

The framework represents a combination of current decentralized tools available for building decentralized applications.

It is built with Nodejs. For communication between users it uses [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs). For a distributed database solution is using [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db).


The project has extension modules each with their own repository:

Chat extension : https://github.com/chelneru/chat-extension-module

Version control extension :https://github.com/chelneru/git-extension-module

Project managemnt extesion : https://github.com/chelneru/git-bug-extension-module

The project is mainly finished regarding its main features. Currently I am working on polishing and add some tests.
